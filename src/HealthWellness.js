      </h3>
      One of the core principles of Aayush Wellness is personalization. Each individual has a unique constitution, or 'Prakriti,' according to Ayurveda. This constitution determines how a person responds to different foods, activities, and environments. Aayush Wellness tailors its recommendations to each person's specific needs, ensuring that the approach to health is customized and effective.

      </h3>
      Prevention is a key focus of Aayush Wellness. Rather than waiting for illness to occur, Aayush Wellness encourages individuals to adopt preventive measures that keep them healthy. These measures include:
Diet and Nutrition: Aayush Wellness emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet that is tailored to an individual's constitution. The right foods can help maintain balance, prevent illness, and support overall health.
Physical Activity: Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining physical health. Aayush Wellness encourages physical activities that align with an individual's constitution, promoting fitness without causing strain.
Mental Well-being: Mental health is as important as physical health. Aayush Wellness incorporates practices like meditation, mindfulness, and stress management techniques to support mental well-being.
Sleep and Rest: Adequate rest is essential for recovery and maintaining energy levels. Aayush Wellness provides guidance on creating healthy sleep habits that align with natural rhythms.
