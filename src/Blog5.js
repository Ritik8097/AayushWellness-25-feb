             <p className="mb-4">
        In the world of health and wellness, the terms <strong>nutraceuticals</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>traditional supplements</strong> are often used interchangeably. However, they
        are distinct categories with unique benefits, formulations, and purposes. Understanding the
        difference between the two can help you make informed decisions about your health.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In this blog, we will dive deep into nutraceuticals vs. traditional supplements, exploring
        their definitions, benefits, and key differences.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Nutraceuticals?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The term <em>"nutraceutical"</em> is a blend of two words: <strong>"nutrition"</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>"pharmaceutical"</strong>. Coined in 1989 by Dr. Stephen DeFelice, nutraceuticals
        refer to products derived from food sources that provide additional health benefits beyond
        basic nutritional value. They often contain bioactive compounds that can prevent chronic
        diseases, improve overall health, and support specific bodily functions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Types of Nutraceuticals:</h3>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Traditional Supplements?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Traditional supplements are products designed to add essential nutrients to your diet. They
        typically contain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other dietary ingredients. Their
        primary purpose is to address nutrient deficiencies, ensuring the body receives the required
        daily intake.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Common Traditional Supplements Include:</h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The choice between nutraceuticals and traditional supplements depends on your health goals:

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>For General Wellness:</strong> Nutraceuticals offer broader health benefits due to
          their natural, bioactive compounds.
        </li>

        While both nutraceuticals and traditional supplements play vital roles in health management,
        they cater to different needs. Nutraceuticals focus on holistic wellness and disease
        prevention, while traditional supplements address specific nutritional gaps. Combining both,
        under professional guidance, can offer a balanced approach to optimal health.
