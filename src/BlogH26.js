                            In a world that's always “on,” where screens glow late into the night and tasks demand constant attention, the idea of “wellness” can often feel out of reach. But it doesn't have to be. Building a daily wellness routine is one of the most powerful tools to bring balance, energy, and clarity into your life.
                            This blog explores simple yet effective routines that support mental balance and physical well-being, without overcomplicating your day. If you’ve ever felt burned out, distracted, or disconnected from yourself, a wellness routine can help you reclaim your rhythm.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="mt-6 font-semibold">Why a Wellness Routine Matters</h2>
                        <p>
                            Wellness is not just the absence of illness; it’s a state of harmony between mind, body, and emotions. Creating a structured daily routine helps reduce stress, increase productivity, improve emotional resilience, and support long-term health.
                            It’s not about perfection. It’s about creating space mentally and physically for restoration, focus, and calm, no matter how busy your day is.

                        <h2 className="mt-6 font-semibold">Morning: Build Momentum with Purpose</h2>
                        <p>How you start your day influences how you live it. A grounded morning routine helps activate the mind and body, giving you control over the day ahead.</p>
